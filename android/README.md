# BoozeBot Android
Android app for BoozeBot

## Setup Notes
1) Ensure that Firebase is enabled in Android Studio by going to: 'File->Project Structure->Cloud' and checking 'Firebase'. 

## TODO
* get rid of weird red lines around EditTexts on login page
* figure out why app title bar isn't going away on actual device (it's gone on layout previews)
