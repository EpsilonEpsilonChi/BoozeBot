# testSite
A site created for testing BoozeBot and Firebase operations. This will be unnecessary once the Android/iOS apps are created.

## The Files
 - **test.html**: open this to view the site (extremely basic, allows adding users/recipes/bottles, and pour drinks)
 - **firebaseFunctions.js**: contains Javascript functions used in test.html to manipulate Firebase
